Website Repository for HW11
by: Arnold Schultz



## Main Web Pages

This is a Website to visualize the weather of 500+ completely random cities.  The weather data for these cities are shown as scatter plots to look at the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The website will allow the user to look at any of the graphs alone with the analysis or all together for quick navigation.  There is also a link to a table of the city data used generated from pandas to HTML.

## Pandas

A pandas jupyter notebook was used to take the data collected as a csv file to output the table to HTML.
